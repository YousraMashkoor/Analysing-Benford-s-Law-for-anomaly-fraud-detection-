# Analysing-Benford-s-Law-for-anomaly-fraud-detection-
Comparing Fibonacci numbers and length of rivers of the world with Benford's law using Matplotlib for data visualization and Pandas for data cleaning

# Introduction
Benford’s Law (Sarkar, 2018), also known as the Law of First Digits or the Phenomenon of Significant Digits, is the finding that the first digits (or numerals to be exact) of the numbers found in series of records of the most varied sources do not display a uniform distribution, but rather are arranged in such a way that the digit “1” is the most frequent, followed by “2”, “3”, and so in a successively decreasing manner down to “9”.
In this report we’d we evaluating benford’s law in three different case scenarios and further evaluating our findings to estimate what are the factors that affect the accuracy of the law and how we could use it with our data. Using following techniques and datasets.
## TECHNIQUES:
•	Excel Sheets
•	Python Program 
## DATASETS:
•	Fibonacci Series
•	Length of Rivers

This report aims to implement Benford’s law in a two set of naturally occurring datasets and make assumptions in accordance with the study of Steven J. Miller (Miller, 2015)
As mentioned above we’d be working on these data and techniques to evaluate our answers through three different cases, in order to excerpt our findings into an entrenched conclusion.
